// DATA SETS
// To work with a chunk of digital data, we'll first have find a way to represent it in our machine's memory.
// we could get creative with a string--after all, string can have any length,so we can put a lot of data into them but this is awkward.
// js provide a data type specifically for storing sequence of value, it is called array and write as a list of value between square brackets, separated by commas.
let listOfNumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11];
console.log(listOfNumbers[2]);  //5
console.log(listOfNumbers[0]);  //2
console.log(listOfNumbers[2 - 1]);  //3
